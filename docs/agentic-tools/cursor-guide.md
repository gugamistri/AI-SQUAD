# AI-SQUAD Guide for Cursor

For the complete workflow, see the [AI-SQUAD Workflow Guide](../bmad-workflow-guide.md).

_Based on the BMad Method framework by Brian (BMad) Madison._

## Installation

When running `npx ai-squad install`, select **Cursor** as your IDE. This creates:

- `.ai-squad-core/` folder with all agents
- `.cursor/rules/` folder with agent rule files (`.mdc`)

## Using AI-SQUAD Agents in Cursor

Type `@agent-name` in chat (Ctrl+L / Cmd+L) to activate an agent. Make sure you select the icon that looks like a small ruler if presented with multiple options in the popup window.

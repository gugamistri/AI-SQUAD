_Based on the BMad Method framework by Brian (BMad) Madison._

## Installation

When running `npx ai-squad install`, select **Trae** as your IDE. This creates:

- `.ai-squad-core/` folder with all agents
- `.trae/rules/` folder with agent rule files (`.md`)

## Using AI-SQUAD Agents in Trae

Type `@agent-name` in chat to activate an agent.
